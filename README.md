# Heart-Disease-UCI-Predictor-
This project focuses on developing a Disease Prediction Toolkit using machine learning techniques to analyze real-world healthcare datasets. By applying models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, we aim to build accurate predictors of heart disease and similar conditions.
